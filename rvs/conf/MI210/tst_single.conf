# TST test
#
# Preconditions:
#   Set device to all and execution as sequential.
#   Workload set as dgemm operations with matrix size as 8640.
#   Throttle temperature set as 100 degree celsius.
#
# Run test with:
#   ./rvs -c conf/tst.conf -d 3
#
# Expected result:
#   The test on each GPU passes (TRUE) if the GPU junction temperature
#   reaches the target temperature. If it reaches the throttle temperature
#   during test duration is also monitored.
