# GST test
#
# Preconditions:
#   Set device to all. If you need to run the rvs only on a subset of GPUs, please run rvs with -g
#   option, collect the GPUs IDs (e.g.: GPU[ 5 - 50599] -> 50599 is the GPU ID) and then specify
#   all the GPUs IDs separated by white space
#   Set parallel execution to true (workload execution on all GPUs in parallel)
#   Set matrix_size to 28000.
#   Set run count to 1 (each test will run twice)
#   Set copy_matrix to false (the matrices will be copied to GPUs only once)
#
# Run test with:
#   cd bin
#   ./rvs -c conf/gst_stress.conf
#
# Expected result:
#   The test on each GPU passes (TRUE) if the GPU achieves 50000 gflops
