# GPUP test #3
#
# Preconditions:
#   only a subset of AMD compatible GPUs (device filtering)
#   all types of devices
#   all gpu properties, all io_link properties
#
# Run test with:
#   cd bin
#   sudo ./rvs -c conf/gpup3.conf
#
# Expected result:
#   Test passes with displaying all properties and io_link properties values for subset of GPUs
#
# Note:
#   Testing specific device, if device numbers are changed in system it should be changed in the test
