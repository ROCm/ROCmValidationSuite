# SMQT test
#
# Preconditions:
#   Set device to all. If you need to run the rvs only on a subset of GPUs, please run rvs with -g
#   option, collect the GPUs IDs (e.g.: GPU[ 5 - 50599] -> 50599 is the GPU ID) and then specify
#   all the GPUs IDs separated by white space.
#   Set each BAR mapping requirements.
#
# Run test with:
#   cd bin
#   sudo ./rvs -c conf/smqt_single.conf -d 3
#
# Expected result:
# True if platformâ€™s SBIOS has satisfied the BAR mapping requirements for each GPUs.
#
# Note: BAR requirements are platform specific so peoper values has be set based on it.
# Below values are just sample arbitrary values.
