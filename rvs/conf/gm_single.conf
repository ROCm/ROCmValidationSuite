# GM test
#
# Preconditions:
#   Set device to all. If you need to run the rvs only on a subset of GPUs, please run rvs with -g
#   option, collect the GPUs IDs (e.g.: GPU[ 5 - 50599] -> 50599 is the GPU ID) and then specify
#   all the GPUs IDs separated by white space.
#   Set monitor to true for monitoring to start.
#
# Run test with:
#   cd bin
#   sudo ./rvs -c conf/gm_single.conf -d 3
#
# Expected result:
#   Monitor metrics for 30 seconds and display average values for junction temperature,
#   memory clock, system clock, fan % and power for each GPU on the machine. Also display
#   bound value violations during the monitor duration.
