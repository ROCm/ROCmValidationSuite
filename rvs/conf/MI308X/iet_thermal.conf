# IET thermal test
#
# Preconditions:
#   Set device to all. If you need to run the rvs only on a subset of GPUs, please run rvs with -g
#   option, collect the GPUs IDs (e.g.: GPU[ 5 - 50599] -> 50599 is the GPU ID) and then specify
#   all the GPUs IDs separated by comma.
#   Set parallel execution to true (gemm workload execution on all GPUs in parallel)
#   Test duration set to 10 mins.
#   Target power set to 600W for each GPU.
#
# Run test with:
#   cd bin
#   ./rvs -c conf/MI308X/iet_thermal.conf
#
# Expected result:
#   The test on each GPU passes (TRUE) if the GPU achieves power target of 600W.
