# GST test - gst-thermal-dgemm-true
#
# Preconditions:
#   Set device to all. If you need to run the rvs only on a subset of GPUs, please run rvs with -g
#   option, collect the GPUs IDs (e.g.: GPU[ 5 - 50599] -> 50599 is the GPU ID) and then specify
#   all the GPUs IDs separated by white space
#   Set matrices sizes to 8640 * 8640 * 8640
#   Set matrices batch size to 96
#   Set gemm operation type as dgemm real
#   Set gemm operation mode as batched strided gemm
#   Set matrix data initialization method as hip random integer
#   Set copy_matrix to false (the matrices will be copied to GPUs only once)
#   Set target stress GFLOPS as 24700 GFLOPS (~24.7 TFLOPS)
#
# Expected result:
#   The test on each GPU passes (TRUE) if the GPU achieves 24.7 TFLOPS or more
#   within the test duration of 10 mins after ramp-up duration of 10 seconds.
#   Else test on the GPU fails (FALSE).
